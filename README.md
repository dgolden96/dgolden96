Hey there, my name is Daniel Golden, and I'm currently completing the final requirements of Boston University's MS program in bioinformatics.
During the summer of 2022, I'll be working with Zoey Werbin in Boston University's Bhatnagar Lab. We'll be constructing a Kraken2 database of soil microbe genomes.
I am currently seeking employment opportunities to begin in late August or the beginning of September in the greater Boston area.
